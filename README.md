I’ve spent 20+ years maintaining the most complex, real-time embedded system in existence: **The Human Body.** In the trauma bay, there is no 'Undo' button. You debug in real-time under extreme pressure. I am now porting that high-stakes logic to **Silicon and Copper.**

> "If I can debug a crashing patient in a trauma bay, I can definitely find your missing semicolon."

### 🔬 The Mission
I’m not here to build "fluff." I’m here to understand the machine from the electricity up. My journey is about translating biological systems into digital ones.

### 🛠 The Current Stack
- **Cybersecurity:** Hardening systems (Google Prof. Cert)
- **Computer Science:** Deep diving into the fundamentals (CS50x)
- **Embedded:** Interfacing with the physical world (SunFounder Pico Kit)
- **Logic:** Exploring the foundation of Silicon & Copper.

*Found my first bug in a QBasic book at 12; still chasing the perfect logic today.*
